# TAKI Game
**Objective**
The project focuses on developing a digital version of the TAKI card game. This was my first ever project in coding, done in my first year of studies. This game involves multiple players, turn-based mechanics, and a range of card actions such as skipping turns, changing colors, and drawing extra cards. The goal is to create a fun and engaging experience while applying key concepts in software engineering, including user input handling, game logic, and player interaction.

**Skills Learned**
- Game Logic Design: Experience in designing and implementing rules and logic for a multiplayer card game.
- Problem Solving: Debugging complex game scenarios and managing user inputs for a seamless gaming experience.

**Tools Used**
- C Language: The core programming language used to implement the game logic and mechanics.
- Visual Studio Code: Used as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, testing, and debugging.
- GitHub: For version control and managing the project's repository.
